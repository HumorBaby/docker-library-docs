## `%%IMAGE%%:<version>-slim`

This image uses the `slim` version of the `python` image contained in the default tag, which only contains the minimal packages needed to run `python`. Unless you are working in an environment where *only* the `%%IMAGE%%` image will be deployed, and you have space constraints, we recommend using the default image of this repository.
